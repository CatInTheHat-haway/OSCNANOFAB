# BEFORE YOU START
**Jupiter Scientific (Callisto)**: switch from BYPASS to RUN mode 

  stop light will change from red to green when ready

# Process
Put cassete in load chamber: Release A -> Clamp A

Select wafer -> select to move -> elevator slot -> destination for move 

wafer -> control handler 

  Load Chamber Vacuum: OPEN (start vacuum pump for loadlock chamber pressure) 

**RUN CLEAN CYCLE** 

Chamber A-> monitor process (to view runtime/details)

  when ready: Move wafer to Chamber A -> Wait a minute for wafer to warm up 

**RUN DEPOSTION CYCLE** 

when done: move wafer to elevator from Chamber A -> wait for wafer to cool down before moving to (PLASTIC) cassette 

**RUN CLEAN CYCLE** 

to release cassete: Clamp A -> Release A

## Depostion vs Clean cycles 
IN,CLEAN time = DEPO time

OUT,CLEAN time = half DEPO time
